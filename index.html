  <h1 id="ggggggggg">My Unofficial Local Guide to (north) Astoria</h1>
  <p id="intro">Between 31st and Hazen is the semi-industrial zoned part of Astoria. 
    The majority of the area's livelihood comes from Ditmars boulevard, specifically from 31st street to Steinway. 
    The rest of the neighborhood is split between residences and industrial things, like the Steinway Piano factory
     and a ridiculous amount of auto shops. The neighborhood is directly adjacent to the Con Ed plant that lies on
      the bank of the East river. Astoria is a very large neighborhood, so we'll only be looking at the area between the 
      Ditmars boulevard subway station
       and the East river.</p>

  <p class="jim-nightshade-regular">Have you ever wanted to film a horror movie? You can just walk down 38th street in the direction of Berrian Boulevard,
     and you'll come to this eerie dead end!</p>
     <ul class="jim-nightshade-regular">
      <li>Want a break from the noise of NYC? The only noise up here is the sound of occasional car repair and the constant thrum of several colossal fans!</li>
      <li>Like pianos? You get to pass the Steinway Piano factory (you can't see inside, but you can pass by it!)</li>
      <li>Are you interested in cars? There are a bunch of broken down cars at the end of this road. Also, an EXTREMELY sketchy bus!</li>
     </ul>

  <p class="fleur-de-leah-regular">Okay...you want somewhere to hang out? Look no further than 31st street, the neighborhood's commercial hub! We have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fleur-de-leah-regular">The            C  V  S where every single aisle is partially behind plexiglass!</li>
    <li class="fleur-de-leah-regular">The Target they delayed for two years because they thought the area was a shoplifting risk. It has two floors!</li>
<li class="fleur-de-leah-regular">T  J     Maxx (you will find nothing you need and a lot of ridiculous products!)</li>
<li id="burlingtonsucks">Burlington- nevermind. Don't go to Burlington. It's a wreck.</li>
<li class="fleur-de-leah-regular">Five Below! Where everything now costs more than five dollars.</li>

  <p class="diplomata-sc-regular">Do you have money? Do you like bowling? About a block from the entrance to Riker's Island is Bowl 360!</p>
  <ul class="diplomata-sc-regular">
    <li>Want food? How about a $40 fry basket to share!</li>
    <li>Do you like music from 2015? So do they!</li>
    <li>Do you want lasers when you bowl? They have loads!</li>
    <li>Do you like to win? can't help you there, pal.
