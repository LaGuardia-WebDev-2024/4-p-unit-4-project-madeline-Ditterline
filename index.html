  <h1>My Unofficial Local Guide to (north) Astoria</h1>
  <p>Between 31st and Hazen is the semi-industrial zoned part of Astoria. 
    The majority of the area's livelihood comes from Ditmars boulevard, specifically from 31st street to Steinway. 
    The rest of the neighborhood is split between residences and industrial things, like the Steinway Piano factory
     and a ridiculous amount of auto shops. The neighborhood is directly adjacent to the Con Ed plant that lies on
      the bank of the East river. Astoria is a very large neighborhood, so we'll only be looking at the area between the 
      Ditmars boulevard subway station
       and the East river.</p>
